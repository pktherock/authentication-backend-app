# Welcome to Authentication API

- built by using Node, express and MongoDB

## Features

- Authentication and Authorization using jwt token
- Session management
- Login
- Register
- Update Profile
- Update Email
- Update Password
- Global Error Handling
- Logging Request and errors
- Extensible code flow and Folder structure
- Best env variable setup

## Code Flow

- First browser sends the request to the server
- Server points to our specific routes
- before the controller, it may be that there will be middlewares or validators or maybe both
- If no Middleware of the validator then the request goes to the specific controller
- Controllers will send back the response, if no need to call services
- Services are basically functions that help us to get data from DB (here is Mongo DB)
- Service may use models to save data in some specific format

Note:
Middleware/validators may or may not be there
Services/models may or may not be there
